description: As part of my undergraduate coursework in 2016, I designed a website for a science communication project entitled 'Catapults to Cannons: Projectile Motion Through History'. This is intended to educate A-level students on the use of projectile motion in warfare through history, detailing the inventions of various weapons and the physics of the guiding principles behind their operation. It accomplishes this through the medium of text, images, videos, animations and an interactive quiz.
