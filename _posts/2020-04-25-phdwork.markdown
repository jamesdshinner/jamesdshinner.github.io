description: For my doctoral thesis, I am researching the properties of the top quark, the heaviest of the fundamental particles. I am investigating a novel method to use the top quark to measure the asymmetry of the laws of physics between matter and antimatter. This involves working with a terabyte-scale dataset, and applying both regression and classification algorithms to analyse this data.
