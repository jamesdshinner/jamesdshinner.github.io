description: As well as working on physics analysis, I worked to redesign the database that configures all of the trigger systems for the ATLAS detector. By replacing the existing relational database with a simpler structure that makes use of the JSON data format, the time needed to load and edit the database was reduced from up to an hour to < 0.5s. I also wrote a suite of Python scripts to perform all the database interactions.
